# DND 5E Spell Tracker

Spell Tracker for D&amp;D 5E

Demo: http://richhuynh.com/spelltracker/


The Spelltracker is used to help Dungeons and Dragons 5E players keep track of their "Spell Slot" uses. The Spelltracker is created with javascript, jQuery, and js-Cookie. 


USAGE
The player can update the "Max" and "Current" values by selecting the value's input field, typing a new value, and deselecting the input field.
The "Long Rest" button sets all current values to max.
The "+" and "-" buttons iterate the "Current" value by 1  or -1 respectively.
"Hide Unused Slots" hides individual slot trackers if their "Max" value is 0.

SAVE
Spelltracker uses cookies in order to save data. Data is automatically saved after every user input. 
Clicking the "Save" button will reveal an "Import Code." The user may decide to save this code if they tend to clear their cookies. 

IMPORT
In order to load a save with the "Import Code," the user must click the "Import" button to reveal an "Import Code" field next to a "Load" button. The user pastes the "Import Code" into the field and clicks the "Load" button.
